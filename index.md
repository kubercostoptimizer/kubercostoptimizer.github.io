## Spoiled Apples Ruin the Bunch: Anatomy of Google Play Malware

Due to the rising popularity of smart phones, malware in the Android field has been increasing exponentially. With this rise, malware has increasingly evolved to bypass the defenses of the Google Play Store. Analyzing properties of such malware is an important step towards our ability to build efficient malware detection tools. In this study, we perform a detailed analysis on a set of recent Android malware bypassing the defenses of Google Play Store between 2016 to 2021. In particular, we collect event and check conditions, hiding techniques, payloads, as well as code properties of the malware. We further relate the properties into a detailed malware signature graph. Lastly, we discussed the implications of our findings to the space of malware detection in context with our collected dataset.
